Developed an operating system for an amplifier that controls the audio signal processing and amplification functions.
Implemented the software using the Arduino programming language and the Arduino mega microcontroller with Audio Processor BD37534FV.
Developed a user interface for the amplifier using a 20x4 LCD display and IR remote and a rotary encoder with push button functionality.
